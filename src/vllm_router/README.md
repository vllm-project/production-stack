# Router

The source code for the request router.

## Key features

- Support routing to endpoints that run different models
- Exporting observability metrics for each serving engine instance, including QPS, time-to-first-token (TTFT), number of pending/running/finished requests, and uptime
- Support automatic service discovery and fault tolerance by Kubernetes API
- Model aliases
- Multiple different routing algorithms
  - Round-robin routing
  - Session-ID based routing
  - (WIP) prefix-aware routing

## Running the router

The router can be configured using command-line arguments. Below are the available options:

### Basic Options

- `--host`: The host to run the server on. Default is `0.0.0.0`.
- `--port`: The port to run the server on. Default is `8001`.

### Service Discovery Options

- `--service-discovery`: The service discovery type. Options are `static` or `k8s`. This option is required.
- `--static-backends`: The URLs of static serving engines, separated by commas (e.g., `http://localhost:8000,http://localhost:8001`).
- `--static-models`: The models running in the static serving engines, separated by commas (e.g., `model1,model2`).
- `--static-aliases`: The aliases of the models running in the static serving engines, separated by commas and associated using colons (e.g., `model_alias1:model,mode_alias2:model`).
- `--static-backend-health-checks`: Enable this flag to make vllm-router check periodically if the models work by sending dummy requests to their endpoints.
- `--k8s-port`: The port of vLLM processes when using K8s service discovery. Default is `8000`.
- `--k8s-namespace`: The namespace of vLLM pods when using K8s service discovery. Default is `default`.
- `--k8s-label-selector`: The label selector to filter vLLM pods when using K8s service discovery.

### Routing Logic Options

- `--routing-logic`: The routing logic to use. Options are `roundrobin` or `session`. This option is required.
- `--session-key`: The key (in the header) to identify a session.

### Monitoring Options

- `--engine-stats-interval`: The interval in seconds to scrape engine statistics. Default is `30`.
- `--request-stats-window`: The sliding window seconds to compute request statistics. Default is `60`.

### Logging Options

- `--log-stats`: Log statistics every 30 seconds.

### Dynamic Config Options

- `--dynamic-config-json`: The path to the json file containing the dynamic configuration.

### Sentry Options

- `--sentry-dsn`: The Sentry Data Source Name to use for error reporting.
- `--sentry-traces-sample-rate`: The sample rate for Sentry traces (0.0 to 1.0). Default is 0.1 (10%).
- `--sentry-profile-session-sample-rate`: The sample rate for Sentry profiling sessions (0.0 to 1.0). Default is 1.0 (100%).

## Build docker image

```bash
docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

## Example commands to run the router

You can install the router using the following command:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

If you want to run the router with the semantic cache, you can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -e .[semantic_cache]
```

**Example 1:** running the router locally at port 8000 in front of multiple serving engines:

```bash
vllm-router --port 8000 \
    --service-discovery static \
    --static-backends "http://localhost:9001,http://localhost:9002,http://localhost:9003" \
    --static-models "facebook/opt-125m,meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,facebook/opt-125m" \
    --static-aliases "gpt4:meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct" \
    --static-model-types "chat,chat,chat" \
    --static-backend-health-checks \
    --engine-stats-interval 10 \
    --log-stats \
    --routing-logic roundrobin
```

## Backend health checks

By enabling the `--static-backend-health-checks` flag, **vllm-router** will send a simple request to
your LLM nodes every minute to verify that they still work.
If a node is down, it will output a warning and exclude the node from being routed to.

If you enable this flag, its also required that you specify `--static-model-types` as we have to use
different endpoints for each model type.

> Enabling this flag will put some load on your backend every minute as real requests are send to the nodes
> to test their functionality.

## Dynamic Router Config

The router can be configured dynamically using a json file when passing the `--dynamic-config-json` option.
The router will watch the json file for changes and update the configuration accordingly (every 10 seconds).

Currently, the dynamic config supports the following fields:

**Required fields:**

- `service_discovery`: The service discovery type. Options are `static` or `k8s`.
- `routing_logic`: The routing logic to use. Options are `roundrobin` or `session`.

**Optional fields:**

- (When using `static` service discovery) `static_backends`: The URLs of static serving engines, separated by commas (e.g., `http://localhost:9001,http://localhost:9002,http://localhost:9003`).
- (When using `static` service discovery) `static_models`: The models running in the static serving engines, separated by commas (e.g., `model1,model2`).
- (When using `k8s` service discovery) `k8s_port`: The port of vLLM processes when using K8s service discovery. Default is `8000`.
- (When using `k8s` service discovery) `k8s_namespace`: The namespace of vLLM pods when using K8s service discovery. Default is `default`.
- (When using `k8s` service discovery) `k8s_label_selector`: The label selector to filter vLLM pods when using K8s service discovery.
- `session_key`: The key (in the header) to identify a session when using session-based routing.

Here is an example dynamic config file:

```json
{
    "service_discovery": "static",
    "routing_logic": "roundrobin",
    "static_backends": "http://localhost:9001,http://localhost:9002,http://localhost:9003",
    "static_models": "facebook/opt-125m,meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,facebook/opt-125m"
}
```

### Get current dynamic config

If the dynamic config is enabled, the router will reflect the current dynamic config in the `/health` endpoint.

```bash
curl http://<router_host>:<router_port>/health
```

The response will be a JSON object with the current dynamic config.

```json
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "dynamic_config": <current_dynamic_config (JSON object)>
}
```
